## ðŸ§  Why

There is an excellent action already: [firebase-action](https://github.com/w9jds/firebase-action), but it forces you to run a command in order to work.

With this one, after running the action you can use the firebase-tools CLI from anywhere: npm script, shell...

## ðŸš€ Usage

Simply add the action to get access to the firebase CLI.

```yaml
jobs:
  setup-firebase:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1 # This is optional on linux and macOS
      - uses: pocket-studios/action-setup-firebase@v1
        with:
          firebase-token: YOUR_TOKEN
```

By default, it will try to download the package from npm,
if it fails because npm is not installed, or it doesn't have sufficient permissions,
the action will fallback to download it using `curl`.

If you are running it on Windows you will need to use actions/setup-node before in order to work.
